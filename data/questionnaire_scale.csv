"Rating","Description"
"1","This isn’t a good sentence. It’s impossible to understand. I would not use this sentence. No speaker from Singapore would use this sentence."
"2","This sentence is better than one I’d rate as 1, but it’s still very bad. It’s very difficult to understand. Most people from Singapore would definitely not say this."
"3","This sentence is not good enough to be rated 4, but it’s better than a 2. It’s difficult to understand. Somebody from Singapore might use it, but I’d be unlikely to use it myself."
"4","This sentence is less than perfect. It sounds a bit strange to me. Other people from Singapore might use it, but I’m not totally comfortable with it."
"5","This sentence sounds fine. I’d use it without hesitation, and so would other people from Singapore."
